# Flutter Studies


This repository showcases my foundational studies and experiments with **Dart**, primarily utilizing **Flutter for Android App development**. It includes various projects and code samples that explore different concepts and techniques in mobile development.

## Projects:

 * <h3>Currency Converter</h3>
   This Flutter-based project implements a simple Currency Converter app using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The application allows users to seamlessly convert currencies between USD (Dollar) and BRL (Brazilian Real). 
   
   <h4>Key Features:</h4>
   
   <!-- * Real-time Currency Conversion: Fetches live exchange rates for accurate conversions. -->

   * MVC Architecture: Clear separation of concerns between the UI, data models, and business logic for maintainability.

   * User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for easy usage.

   * Currency Exchange History: Track your conversions from your history table.

   <h4>Technologies</h4>

   * Dart v.3.5.3
   * Flutter v.3.24.3
   * MVC architectural pattern

   This project is ideal for learning how to handle user inputs, and applying design patterns like MVC in Flutter.
